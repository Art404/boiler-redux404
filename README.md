# platform404

Front-end renderer app for [Art404](http://www.art404.com)'s CMS platform. The aim is to provide a navigable, contextualized display of our work while allowing third party social networks to host the majority of our content. Projects can then be posted naturally on networks with audiences such as tumblr, instagram or github and then be packaged up with the additional metadata for display in a portfolio context. 


# Usage


### Environment Variables

Variable | Description
:------- | :----------
firebase\_url | The Firebase server to listen to.

DEV:

* `firebase_url=XXX npm start`
* VISIT `localhost:3000`

BUILD:

* `npm run build`
* `firebase_url=XXX NODE_ENV=production npm start`
* VISIT `localhost:3000`

DEPLOY:

* add new git commit
* `git push heroku master`


# API

Without authorizing, the database is read only, with the following endpoints available:

Endpoint | Description
:------- | :----------
db | repository of all projects where each key is a project ID.
main | holds the sites page configuration. eventually we will have alternate page configurations for different members / purposes so `main` will be distinguished.
squad | array of members with the following self-explainable properties: `name`, `role`, `url`.

You can access the api from any node app with firebase like so:

```js
var Firebase = require('firebase');
var fireAssAPI = new Firebase(process.env.firebase_url);

function doSomeCrazyShitWithProjectData (data) {
  console.log('holy shit ->', data.val());
}

fireAssAPI.child('db').once('value', doSomeCrazyShitWithProjectData);
 
```

see [firebase docs](https://www.firebase.com/docs/) for more on using firebase.


# Configuration

All configuration is stored and read from firebase. Refer to `firebase_url` in Heroku for appropriate firebase app. 

### Menu Config

The `pages` object determines the category heirarchy of the site's navigation.

eg given a config that looks like:

```js
{
  "apps": {
    "label": "Apps",
    "url": "apps",
    "icon": "apps_icon.png",
    "layout": {
      // ...
    },
    "submenu": [
      {
        "label": "Javascript",
        "url": "javascript"
      },
      {
        "label": "Python",
        "url": "python"
      },
      {
        "label": "CSS",
        "url": "css"
      }
    ]
  },
  // required, becomes highest level nav link, links to home
  "home": {
    "label": "WORK",
    "layout": {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

The `home` object will become the first link in the menu and will serve as an anchor to the homepage. Any other objects, in this case `Apps`, will become the rest of the links in the menu.


#### Menu Config Properties

Property | Type | Description
:------- | :--- | :----------
label | `String` | This is the label that will be rendered in the browser for all navigation purposes.
url | `String` | This is the slug that will be used in the url, will also be used for any non-browser purposes.
icon | `String` | Direct link to image file that hosts icon for this menu item.
submenu | `Array` | Collection of hashtags that will become the "submenu" when user is on that tag's page.


#### Submenu Config Properties

The submenu links will go to a page that shows a grid view of projects that contain both the submenu tag + its parent tag.

Property | Type | Description
:------- | :--- | :----------
label | `String` | This is the label that will be rendered in the browser.
url | `String` | Where the submenu link will go to.
bold | `Bool` | Makes the link bold.
color | `Bool` | Makes the link it's page color.


### Page Config

For every object in `pages`, the `layout` property will determine the components rendered on the page + where they get content from.

eg:

```js
{
  "home": {
    "label": "WORK",
    "layout": {
      "banner": {
        "projects": [
          "138398520861",
          "139572811486",
          "101728537521"
        ],
        "tags": [
          "viral"
        ],
        "type": "scroller"
      },
      "rows": [
        {
          "content": {
            "projects": [
              "121467069611",
              "120898900716",
              "120898177576"
            ],
            "subtitle_tags": [
              "open source",
              "JavaScript",
              "web"
            ],
            "tags": [
              "code"
            ],
            "title": "Code",
            "url": "code"
          }
        },
        {
          "content": {
            "subtitle_tags": [
              "branding",
              "identity",
              "logo"
            ],
            "tags": [
              "design"
            ],
            "title": "Design",
            "url": "design"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Will produce a page with a scroller banner, and two `Row` components; `Code` & `Design`.


#### Page `layout` Properties

Property | Type | Description
:------- | :--- | :----------
banner | `object` | Contains project IDs and or tags to pull in (both optional but need at least 1).
banner.type | `String` | Currently the only banner type supported is `scroller`.
projects | `array` | Always refers to an array of project IDs that take precedence over any tagged projects.
tags | `Array` | Collection of tags that will be pulled into the component after any projects.
rows | `Array` | These will render `Row` components in order with the projects & tags.


#### Row `content` Properties

Property | Type | Description
:------- | :--- | :----------
projects | `array` | Always refers to an array of project IDs that take precedence over any tagged projects.
tags | `Array` | Collection of tags that will be pulled into the component after any projects.
title | `String` | The title of the `Row`.
url | `String` | Where the "see more" button of a `Row` will link to.
subtitle_tags | `Array` | Will be rendered underneath the `title` as a collection of clickable tag links.


### Project Data Model

While projects come from various sources, all of their data models are adopted to fit platform404's expected model. This happens via [the-standardizer](http://github.com/artnotfound/the-standardizer).

# TODO

* Fix build process. Because Heroku doesnt have cli capabilities, we use a hacky `deploy.js` script on postinstall. This forces us to include dev dependencies in the regular dependencies, adds deployment bloat & looks weird
* Centralize image assets. Right now it's a mix of CDNs, local images, and hotlinks lol
* Make menu icons + colors come from config. Right now they are hardcoded
* Support `Row` on all pages, currently limited to front page (these should be dynamically created)
* Clean up CSS
* Refactor / comment some of the more complex bits like the layout creator, menu and project pages
* Write Tests


# Future

* Cookie based "seen" projects with total counter
* Dynamically change database source with special route
* More banner + row + card types
